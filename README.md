Intelligent Water Management System

Project Overview: 
Our system harnesses the power of data and machine learning to analyze water quality parameters and classify water samples as potable or non-potable. Using Python and libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn, we crafted a robust solution for intelligent water management.

Key Features: 
1. Data Exploration & Visualization
We embarked on a comprehensive exploration of water quality data, visualizing the distribution of individual features and identifying potential outliers through insightful histograms and box plots.

2. Model Training & Evaluation
Leveraging a Random Forest classifier, we trained the model on a diverse dataset, achieving high accuracy in both training and testing phases. Rigorous evaluation metrics, including classification reports, ensured the reliability of our model.

3. Empowering Decision-Making
This system empowers water management authorities to make informed decisions regarding water potability, facilitating proactive measures for ensuring public health and safety.

4. Sustainable Resource Management
By enabling early detection of water quality issues, this system promotes sustainable water resource management practices, minimizing waste and optimizing resource allocation.

Project Impact: 
The "Intelligent Water Management System" holds immense potential to revolutionize water quality assessment and management practices, contributing to a safer and more sustainable future for communities worldwide.

Dataset: 
This project utilizes the "Water Quality and Potability" Dataset from Kaggle, which provides comprehensive data on water quality parameters and potability assessments.
